- Updated the WhatIDo component to use Font Awesome 6 icons from react-icons
- Updated the Header component to include all four pages: Home, What I Do, About Me, and Blog.
- Fixed the blog page to display blog posts directly instead of using the WhatIDo component.
- Created a new About component that focuses on personal information.
- Updated the About page to use the new About component.
- Created a new What I Do page that focuses on professional work.
- Modified the WhatIDo component to display professional skills and projects instead of blog posts.
- Previous focus: Fixed build issues with Astro site.
- Added site URL 'https://manuelito.tech' to astro.config.mjs to fix RSS feed generation.
- Successfully built the static site with `npm run build`.

**Next Steps:** 
- Polish and align colors and icons throughout the site for visual consistency

- Deploy the successfully built site.
- Continue to ensure the button component is styled correctly and used consistently throughout the project.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:** 
- Using react-icons (Font Awesome 6) for consistent icon rendering instead of Unicode emojis
- Organized the site into four main sections: Home, What I Do (professional), About Me (personal), and Blog (articles).
- Separated personal (About) and professional (What I Do) content into different pages for better organization.
- The site URL is now set to 'https://manuelito.tech' in the Astro configuration.
- How to best style the button component to fit the overall design of the website.
