# Tech Context

**Technologies Used:** Astro, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, MDX, Astro-icon

**Development Setup:** The project uses `bun` as the package manager (based on the `bun.lockb` file).

**Technical Constraints:** The project is likely constrained by the limitations of static site generation, requiring dynamic functionality to be implemented through client-side JavaScript or external APIs.

**Dependencies:** The `package.json` file lists the project's dependencies, including `@astrojs/*`, `astro`, `astro-icon`, `hamburgers`, and `tailwindcss`. The project also uses custom color definitions (red, pblue, pgreen, ppink, pyellow, ppurlple, pblack, white) in the Tailwind CSS configuration.
