# Progress

**What Works:** The basic website structure is in place, with a homepage, about page, and blog. The site is styled with Tailwind CSS and has a responsive design. A reusable Button component has been created and integrated into the Hero component.

**What's Left to Build:** The specific content for each page needs to be finalized. The blog section needs more content. Any dynamic functionality or integrations need to be implemented. The button component needs to be used consistently throughout the project.

**Current Status:** The project is in the initial stages of development.

**Known Issues:** None apparent at this time.
