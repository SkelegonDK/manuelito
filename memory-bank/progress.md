# Progress

**What Works:** The website now has a complete navigation structure with four main pages: Home, What I Do (professional), About Me (personal), and Blog (articles). The site is styled with Tailwind CSS and has a responsive design. Icons are now properly rendered using react-icons (Font Awesome 6) instead of Unicode emojis. A reusable Button component has been created and integrated into the Hero component. The site now builds successfully with the RSS feed properly configured. The About page contains personal information, the What I Do page focuses on professional work, and the Blog page displays blog posts.

**What's Left to Build:** Polish and align colors and icons throughout the site for visual consistency. Customize the About and What I Do pages with actual personal information and professional experience. Deploy the successfully built site. The specific content for each page needs to be finalized. The blog section needs more content. Any dynamic functionality or integrations need to be implemented. The button component needs to be used consistently throughout the project.

**Current Status:** The project has a successful build with all static assets generated. Content organization has been improved by separating personal and professional information into dedicated pages. The navigation structure is complete with all four main sections. Icon rendering issues have been fixed by implementing react-icons. Ready for visual polishing, content customization, and deployment.

**Known Issues:** Need to polish and align colors and icons throughout the site for visual consistency. Previous build issues with RSS feed generation have been resolved by adding the site URL to the Astro configuration.
