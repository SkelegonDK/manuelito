# 10x Rubber Duck: Cline Expanded

## Introduction: Why Cline?
I've been deeply exploring AI-assisted development lately, and I've discovered that working deliberately with coding assistants can transform your development workflow. After months of experimentation, I want to share a practical guide that's made a significant difference in my daily work.

## The Power of Structured AI Assistance
To be fair, having an AI assistant that can produce high-quality code quickly is both exciting and challenging. The key is establishing a structured workflow that keeps you in control while maximizing the benefits. That's where Cline comes in it's not just another coding assistant, it's your enhanced rubber duck debugger that actually writes code.

## Essential Setup Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
First things first, you'll need:
- VSCode (or any of its forks)
- An Anthropic API key (grab one from the Anthropic console)
- The Cline extension

### 2. Getting Started
1. Head over to the [Cline extension page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev) and install it
2. Add your Anthropic API key in the Cline settings
3. Choose your model:
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Most capable, ideal for complex tasks
   - Claude 3.5 Haiku: Great performance, more cost-effective

Pro tip: $10 of credits usually lasts me a week or two of active development.

## The Secret Sauce: Structured Memory System

Here's where things get interesting. I've developed a two-document system that acts as your AI's memory:

### 1. Long-term Memory (design.md)
- Project architecture
- Core decisions
- Implementation strategy
- Key constraints
- Technical requirements

### 2. Short-term Memory (todo.md)
- Current sprint tasks
- Implementation details
- Progress tracking
- Immediate concerns
- Recent changes

### Custom Instructions Magic
Here's the game-changing custom instruction I use with Cline:

> **Always read the design.md document and the todo.md document. Update the design document when significant changes are made. Always update the todo before finishing a task with meaningful descriptions of the tasks and changes.**

This ensures Cline maintains context across sessions, understanding both the big picture and immediate tasks.

## Practical Implementation Tips

### Getting Started
1. Begin with thorough planning in regular Claude
2. Create a detailed design document
3. Break down tasks in your todo list
4. Let Cline guide your implementation

### Best Practices
- Regularly review and update both documents
- Keep task descriptions clear and specific
- Document significant changes immediately
- Use Cline for code review and improvements

## Reality Check
Cline won't do your engineering for you - it's a powerful assistant, not a replacement for careful thinking and planning. The structured approach I've described helps maintain control while maximizing the benefits of AI assistance.

## Next Steps
Take some time to refine your ideas using regular Claude before diving in. The initial investment in creating a solid design document pays off tremendously as you start working with Cline.
