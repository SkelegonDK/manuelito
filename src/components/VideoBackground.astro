<!-- 
  DEPRECATED: This component's functionality has been moved to BaseLayout.astro
  to ensure the video background persists across page transitions.
  
  This component is still used by Hero.astro to add the video background class to the body.
  It doesn't render any HTML elements - the actual video is in BaseLayout.astro.
-->

<script>
  // Add class to body when page loads
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    document.body.classList.add('has-video-bg');
  });
